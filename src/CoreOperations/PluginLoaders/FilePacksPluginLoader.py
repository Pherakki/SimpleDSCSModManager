class BaseFilepack:
    """
    Base class for the basic elements iterated over in the build graph.
    Each "filepack" represents a collection of one or more file targets that 
    must be collected together for some purpose, such as packing or 
    dependencies.
    The individual file targets in the filepack are intended to be patched 
    individually; the collection is used for determining the source files, 
    pack targets, and pack dependencies.
    
    There are five main categories of file referred to by a filepack:
        a) "Pack Targets":       These are the names of the modded asset files 
                                 that are installed to the game assets.
        b) "Source Targets":     These are the names of vanilla game assets
                                 required to *build* the modded assets.
        c) "Dependency Targets": These are the names of vanilla game assets
                                 required to make the modded assets work inside
                                 the game, but not necessary for building.
                                 E.g. Shaders for model files.
        d) "Resource Targets":   The names of unpacked "Source Targets" stored
                                 by the mod manager in its "resources" folder.
        e) "File Targets":       An intermediate step between the "Resource 
                                 Targets" and the "Pack Targets". These are
                                 the files that are directly patched in order
                                 to build the pack targets. For example, the
                                 individual CSV tables of an MBE must be
                                 individually edited before rebuilding them
                                 into the MBE file to be installed.
                                 
    There is usually considerable overlap between these definitions for
    individual filepacks, but many filepacks make distinctions between
    at least some of them.
