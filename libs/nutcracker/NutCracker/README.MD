## Description

This fork's goal is to decompile the Squirrel 2.2.4 64-bit scripts present in the PC release of `Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition` and potentially other releases of the game and/or games produced by MediaVision.

My changes include converting the project to CMake and converting the code from 32-bit Squirrel to 64-bit Squirrel.
The conversion might not be complete yet.
