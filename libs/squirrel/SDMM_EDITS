As required by the Squirrel license, the edits made to the Squirrel distribution included in this repository are as follows:

- No edits are made the the Squirrel source code or repository
- A "py" directory has been added above the Squirrel repo, containing "python.h" and "python.cpp", providing an alternate compile function "_py_Compile" modified from the "Compile" in sq/sq.c
- A "sq.pyx" Cython file has been added above the Squirrel repo, alongside a "setup.py", to allow Python bindings for Squirrel to be compiled to a "sq.*" shared library. The library extension is platform-dependent.
  This module contains the following function definitions:
    - sq.compile(src, dst)
      Asks the Squirrel compiler to turn the source code file at 'src' into compiled file at 'dst'.
